I'm an Italian software developer with a passion for coding. I currently work in the robotics field, but in my free time, I enjoy developing software that meets my own needs. When I believe it could benefit others, I share it online as open-source in this profile.

  <summary><h2>üìú My Developer Journey</h2></summary>

   I started programming at the age of 15 during high school, where I studied computer science. I quickly fell in love with the subject and have pursued this path ever since. During my final year of school, I began working as a developer for a startup, focusing on    embedded systems, blockchain, and communication APIs using FastAPI.

   After graduating, I immediately began working for a robotics company, where I developed plugins for various industrial robots using multiple languages (C, C++, Python, and proprietary languages). I am now involved in a project that integrates artificial   
   intelligence with vision systems in the robotics field.

   Thanks to these two experiences, I‚Äôve learned to quickly adapt to new development environments and programming languages, utilize tools like Docker containers, and deepen my theoretical knowledge of blockchain and robotics.

   In parallel, I am passionate about constantly learning to stay updated in computer science and personal finance. I spend several hours each day studying and coding, and I enjoy every minute of it.

   In the past, I‚Äôve worked with Android Studio, developed management software, and created APIs and Python bots for personal projects. Additionally, I am currently working on a physical software project involving Arduino, applied in the field of magnetic 
   levitation.
